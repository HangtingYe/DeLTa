You are an expert in tabular machine learning domain. I will provide the meta information, the CART tree rules about the prediction task. Please help me design a better rule for inference.
## Meta information about dataset.
{
    "name": "cpu_act",
    "n_num_features": 21,
    "n_cat_features": 0,
    "train_size": 5242,
    "val_size": 1311,
    "test_size": 1639,
    "task_type": "regression",
    "openml_id": 197,
    "n_classes": 1
}

Based on the above information, please learn the rules evolving process and help me design a better rule like what cart used for inference to achieve higher performance.
please not just copy, please refine these rules and create a new better one.
The new rule aims to divide the training space into several regions, where each region is denoted by a unique leaf node id.
The number of leaf nodes should no more than 3.
Please return the dict format of rule, the format should be strictly like: 

self.tree = {
        "feature": 11,
        "threshold": -0.78,
        "operator": "<=",
        "left": {"id": "leaf_1"},  
        "right": {
            "feature": 7,
            "threshold": -0.46,
            "operator": "<=",
            "left": {"id": "leaf_2"},  
            "right": {"id": "leaf_3"}, 
        },
        }

Please note that each leaf id node can only appear once, for example, "id": "leaf_1" can only appear once.
Thus you only need to return the leaf nodes, rather than the true predictions.
