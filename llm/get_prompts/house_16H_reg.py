You are an expert in tabular machine learning domain. I will provide the meta information, the CART tree rules about the prediction task. Please help me design a better rule for inference.

The data\nwere collected as part of the 1990 US census. These are mostly counts\ncumulated at different survey levels. For the purpose of this data set\na level State-Place was used. Data from all states was obtained. Most\nof the counts were changed into appropriate proportions.  There are 4\ndifferent data sets obtained from this database: House(8H) House(8L)\nHouse(16H) House(16L) These are all concerned with predicting the\nmedian price of the house in the region based on demographic\ncomposition and a state of housing market in the region. A number in\nthe name signifies the number of attributes of the data set. A\nfollowing letter denotes a very rough approximation to the difficulty\nof the task. For Low task difficulty, more correlated attributes were\nchosen as signified by univariate smooth fit of that input on the\ntarget. Tasks with High difficulty have had their attributes chosen to\nmake the modelling more difficult due to higher variance or lower\ncorrelation of the inputs to the target.\n\nOriginal source: DELVE repository of data.\nSource: collection of regression datasets by Luis Torgo (ltorgo@ncc.up.pt) at\nhttp://www.ncc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/DataSets.html\nCharacteristics: 22784 cases, 17 continuous attributes.",

## CART tree rules

Based on the above information, please learn the rules evolving process and help me design a better rule like what cart used for inference to achieve higher performance.
please not just copy, please refine these rules and create a new better one.
The new rule aims to divide the training space into several regions, where each region is denoted by a unique leaf node id.
The number of leaf nodes should no more than 3.
Please return the dict format of rule, the format should be strictly like: 

self.tree = {
        "feature": 11,
        "threshold": -0.78,
        "operator": "<=",
        "left": {"id": "leaf_1"},  
        "right": {
            "feature": 7,
            "threshold": -0.46,
            "operator": "<=",
            "left": {"id": "leaf_2"},  
            "right": {"id": "leaf_3"}, 
        },
        }

Please note that each leaf id node can only appear once, for example, "id": "leaf_1" can only appear once.
Thus you only need to return the leaf nodes, rather than the true predictions.
