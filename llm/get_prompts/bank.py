You are an expert in tabular machine learning domain. I will provide the meta information, the CART tree rules about the prediction task. Please help me design a better rule for inference.
## Meta information about dataset.

    "task_intro": "The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).",

Based on the above information, please learn the rules evolving process and help me design a better rule like what cart used for inference to achieve higher performance.
please not just copy, please refine these rules and create a new better one.
The new rule aims to divide the training space into several regions, where each region is denoted by a unique leaf node id.
The number of leaf nodes should no more than 3.
Please return the dict format of rule, the format should be strictly like: 

self.tree = {
        "feature": 11,
        "threshold": -0.78,
        "operator": "<=",
        "left": {"id": "leaf_1"},  
        "right": {
            "feature": 7,
            "threshold": -0.46,
            "operator": "<=",
            "left": {"id": "leaf_2"},  
            "right": {"id": "leaf_3"}, 
        },
        }

Please note that each leaf id node can only appear once, for example, "id": "leaf_1" can only appear once.
Thus you only need to return the leaf nodes, rather than the true predictions.
